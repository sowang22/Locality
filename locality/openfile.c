 *                              openfile.c
 * Assignment: Homework 2 for Comp 40, Fall 2019
 * Authors: Camille Calabrese (ccalab04) and Andreas Moe (amoe01)
 * Date: September 25, 2019
 *
 * Summary: This is the Implementation of the open_file function. open_file is
 *          commonly used across multiple programs, which is why it is in
 *          its own file.
 *
 ***********
 * EDITED by Camille Calabrese (ccalab04) and Sophia Wang (swang30) on
 * October 3rd for Comp 40 HW3
 *       * Changed Parameters of open_file
 *       * Added load_ppm

/*
 * open_file
 *    Purpose: Opens a file from the command line or stdin. Raises an
 *             exception when more than one command line argument is given.
 * Parameters: The number of command line arguments (argc) and the arguments
 *             themselves (argv).
 *    Returns: A file pointer to the open file.
 *    Expects: That only one command line argument is provided, and that the
 *             file exists.
