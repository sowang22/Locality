**************************** ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ****************************
Thank you to Megan Monroe, who helped us during her office hours last week,
and Josh Simani, who helped us understand the UArray methods interface.

************************* IMPLEMENTATION SUCCESS *************************
As far as we can tell, we have successfully implemented all of the
transformations, including the optional ones. Any problems with our
program output we had could be traced to an issue uploading large image
files to the server. We hope the checked runtime errors have been
implemented correctly, but we are not always sure whether we should catch
an execption and keep the program going or if we should abort the program.

For very long, narrow images, the dimensions are correct but the patterns
are not always transformed correctly.
