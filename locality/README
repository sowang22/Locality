**************************** ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ****************************
Thank you to Megan Monroe, who helped us during her office hours last week,
and Josh Simani, who helped us understand the UArray methods interface.

************************* IMPLEMENTATION SUCCESS *************************
As far as we can tell, we have successfully implemented all of the
transformations, including the optional ones. Any problems with our
program output we had could be traced to an issue uploading large image
files to the server. We hope the checked runtime errors have been
implemented correctly, but we are not always sure whether we should catch
an execption and keep the program going or if we should abort the program.

************************** PART E: EXPERIMENTAL **************************

***************************** TIME COMMITMENT ****************************
We spent roughly 20 hours on this assignment.
